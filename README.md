# Pickle to JSON Converter
This is a Python script that allows you to convert Pickle files (.pkl) to JSON files (.json).

# Requirements
Python 3.x
pickle
json

# How to use
1. Save the script to your local machine.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script with the following command:

        python pickle_to_json_converter.py path_to_pickle_file

Replace path_to_pickle_file with the actual path to the Pickle file you want to convert.

4. The script will create a new JSON file in the same directory as the original Pickle file, with the same name but a .json extension.

5. If you want to convert multiple Pickle files at once, you can run the script with a wildcard like this:

        python pickle_to_json_converter.py *.pkl

This will convert all .pkl files in the current directory to JSON files.
